Master Mind is a simple code-breaking board game for two players, invented in 1970 by Mordecai

game called bulls and cows at least as far back as the early 1960s. -- Wikipedia

The computer selects a secret 4 digit number in random. The digits will be unique. The user is given 8
chances to find the number. Each time the user enters a number, the computer calculates the number
of "bulls" and "cows" and prints it. If the matching digits are on their right positions, they are "bulls", if
on different positions, they are "cows". A sample run is shown with the secret number 1435.
